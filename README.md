## 📌 Sequential Learning Topics

### 🔹 1. What is Git & GitHub?
**Git** is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code.  
**GitHub** is a cloud platform where Git repositories can be hosted for collaboration.

🔧 Use Case: Want to work with a team? Git helps track who changed what, while GitHub helps you share your work.

---

### 🔹 2. Creating a GitHub Account
Visit [https://github.com](https://github.com), sign up with your email, choose a username, and you're done!

💡 Tip: Enable 2FA and customize your profile — it's your tech resume!

---

### 🔹 3. Using GitHub
- Create repositories
- Upload files
- Share project links
- Collaborate with others via pull requests and forks

📌 Real-World: Hosting your college or personal projects on GitHub increases visibility and professionalism.

---

### 🔹 4. Uploading Files to GitHub (Manually)
1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the `Add file` button → select `Upload files`.
3. Drag & drop files or browse manually.
4. Add a commit message.
5. Click on `Commit changes`.

📤 This is ideal when you want to share documents, notes, or quick uploads without Git commands.

---

### 🔹 5. Using Git
Install Git → Open terminal → Learn basic commands:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
```

🛠️ Use Case: Initialize Git in any folder to start tracking your code history.

---

### 🔹 6. Configuring Git
Set your global identity for Git:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Vikas"
git config --global user.email "vikas.ambalazari@gmail.com"
```

🔐 Helps link commits to your identity.

---

### 🔹 7. Git with VS Code
Install the Git extension in VS Code.  
You can commit, push, pull, and view file changes visually.

💡 Pro Tip: Use the Source Control tab in VS Code for easy management.

---

### 🔹 8. Clone Command
To copy someone’s GitHub repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name
```

🌍 Perfect when working on team projects or exploring open-source repos.

---

### 🔹 9. Status Command
Check current changes:
```bash
git status
```

🧪 Tells you what’s staged, modified, or untracked in your working directory.

---

### 🔹 10. Add & Commit Commands
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added login feature"
```

✅ `add` stages changes, `commit` saves them to the repo history.

---

### 🔹 11. Push Command
Send your local commits to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

📤 Now your code is on the cloud, ready to share.

---

### 🔹 12. Init Command
Initialize a local Git repository:
```bash
git init
```

📦 It creates a `.git` directory which tracks all changes.

---

### 🔹 13. Pushing Local Repo
If you have an existing project:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

🚀 This connects your local repo to GitHub and pushes the code.

---

### 🔹 14. Workflow
A typical Git workflow:
1. Modify files
2. `git add`
3. `git commit`
4. `git push`

🌀 Helps you keep a structured flow during development.

---

### 🔹 15. Git Branches
Branches allow you to work on new features without affecting the main code:
```bash
git branch new-feature
git checkout new-feature
```

🌿 Great for experiments and feature testing.

---

### 🔹 16. Branch Commands
```bash
git branch         # list branches
git checkout name  # switch branch
git -d branchname  # delete branch
```

🧠 Helps in managing multiple versions of your code.

---

### 🔹 17. Merging Branches
Combine one branch into another:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
```

🔀 Ensures your feature gets added to the main code.

---

### 🔹 18. Pull Command
Update your local repo from GitHub:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

📬 Keeps your code up-to-date with the team.

---

### 🔹 19. Merge Conflicts
Occur when two people edit the same line.  
Resolve manually by editing the conflicting file and then:
```bash
git add .
git commit
```

🧯 Stay calm, fix the lines, and continue!

---

### 🔹 20. Fixing Mistakes
- Undo changes: `git checkout filename`
- Unstage file: `git reset HEAD filename`
- Last commit undo: `git commit --amend`

🛠️ Git is forgiving, don't panic!

---

### 🔹 21. What is Forking?
Creating a copy of someone else’s repo to your own GitHub account.  
Perfect for contributing to open source.

```text
GitHub → Repo → Fork → Clone → Modify → Pull Request
```

🌎 Become an open-source contributor!
